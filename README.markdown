# Description

qtoolbox is a set of tools for everyday [Qt](http://qt.nokia.com) development. A "swiss army knife".
Designed to be minimalistic, does "just what promised, nothing more".

Every "tool" comes with test code, that works also as example code.

If required, tools should provide a README file written in Markdown language ([on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), [on official webpage(http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)).
