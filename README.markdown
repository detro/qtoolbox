# Description

qtoolbox is a set of tools for everyday [Qt](http://qt.nokia.com) development. A "swiss army knife".
Designed to be minimalistic, does "just what promised, nothing more".

Every "tool" comes with test code, that works also as example code.

If required, tools should provide a README file written in Markdown language ([Markdown webpage](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), [on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)).


# Tools

* Debugging Macros (todo)
* Worker Thread (todo)
* Google Maps Widget (todo)
* SQLite Helper (todo)
* PAC file loader (todo)


# Usage

Every tool will be sitting in a separate subdirectory.
A `".pri"` file will be provided, to make it easy to include it within your project. It's not a separate library, just a set of headers/classes.
In addition, a `"test"` subdirectory will contain a test/example application.
